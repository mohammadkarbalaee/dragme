# Drag Me
Throw your own ball on the pitch. 

## What I did
I built the walls and collision first. That was the main challenge that
I faced during the development process. 

## The Images
I had already built a dataset of 200 soccer balls
which I found fun to use in this project too so I used them. 
The images are fetched from the web.

## On web
Drag me is also available on web.
